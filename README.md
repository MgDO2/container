# container
"container" is a container to save data and it's a template class, so you can choose different type data to save and, it can dynamically request memory and auto free memory and 
it's write on my personal.

Additionally, if you want to use my programm, there have a head file call "container.h", and if you include this head file, you need to use a new namespace call "ctr", like this:  
#include "./container.h"
using namespace ctr;

and you can use it!
